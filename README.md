## Description

This application serves as a simple note-taking application that allows the user to quickly save notes to a list, and have the ability to return to that list at a later point in time.

This project allowed me to work on my Express skills, and practice writing routes to direct queries to the server and the corresponding responses from the server correctly.  There is a lot to keep track of with the middleware, and making sure that all the required packages are referenced in the code.

I also learned a lot about using Insomnia to test my routes, and found it to be a helpful tool.

One feature that isn't available yet, is the ability to delete notes.  The DELETE route has not been created yet, as it was not part of the acceptance criteria, but it is a piece of functionality that I would like to add to the project in the future.

The heroku deployment was also something new and a bit of a challenge for me.  The build was successful, but there were a couple changes I needed to make (adding a script for starting, and file structure changes so heroku could access the server.js file).  I am happy to say that I was able to solve those problems by reading some docs, looking at the logs, seeing what went wrong, and making some changes.  Sometimes those are the best opportunities for learning!

Once you have entered your title and text, and "disk" icon appears in the top right navigation bar, and you may click on that icon to save your note.  Once saved, the title will appear on the left side of the screen with the other notes.

## Credits

This code was written primarily with reference to classroom materials.  A tutor helped me with some specific questions and concepts that I had a hard time grasping.  A TA and an LA both served as second sets of eyes to help me see the little issues that were holding up my progress.
